# 👋  Hi there, I'm Aparna!

# 👨🏻‍💻  About Me

  🎓 As an international student, I left my family to pursue a Master's in Data Science & AI at FIU, finally graduating and becoming a Data Scientist.
  
  💻 I love diving into data, analyzing it to predict the future, and finding insights that drive decisions.
  
  💃 In my free time, I enjoy dancing, writing happy quotes, watching movies, and spending time with friends.
  
  🔍 Currently seeking job opportunities in Data Science. Open to collaboration, volunteering, or interesting discussions. Let's connect!
